# We don't want vertical whitespace, but we also don't want it to be a format
# string, in case we default to it.  Rather than being really cagey and
# demanding we use %% and then we s/%%/% in the ident, we just forbid it.

# Another idea is to mark both lazy and then have a before BUILDALL (or
# something) that ensures that at least one is set and allows % in the ident as
# long as an explicit message_fmt was given.  I think this is probably better.
